This project is a fully modular, customizable, and developer-friendly React table library that wraps around Material React Table with additional UI and functional utilites to deliver an enhanced, production-ready reporting experience. Designed using TypeScript with strict typing, the library provides a plug-and-play SmartTable component that includes advanced features like PDF export with preserved grouping and sorting, persistent table state (locally and via backend), deep UI theming through configuration overrides, and robust filtering, sorting, and grouping options. Table manuplation settings and tools are given on saperate UI that is by default left side drawer(customizable). Tables are mobile responsive, In smaller screen table rows are displayed as cards having column data. The table is built for performance and scalability, using row virtualization (react-window) for large datasets and lazy-loaded heavy modules and sync logic to reduce initial bundle size. The library offers tree shaking build optimized for simplicity, hot-reload support in development using Vite, and is structured to support declarative configuration and future plugin extensions (e.g., CSV/Excel export, drag-to-reorder, backend-agnostic adapters). It exposes hooks, state helpers, and utility layers for developers who want granular control, while maintaining clean abstractions. Developer gets DevTools component wrapper to debug live. Jest + React Testing Library, Storybook for UI previews, and live CodeSandbox examples. Babel is configured to ensure wide compatibility, and .d.ts files are bundled for complete type safety. The codebase follows clear naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks), is structured for readability and testability, and avoids overengineering while remaining extensible. Library Development testing is done via storybook. Although built primarily for internal use at your company, this library will be published to NPM and made accessible for any project needing an elegant, high-performance, and deeply configurable table solution.
